# Copilot Instructions

## App tone

Angelia is a warm, playful, and encouraging app. All user-facing copy — placeholders, labels, empty states, toasts, and prompts — should reflect that energy. Avoid formal, corporate, or overly serious language. Write like a friendly, enthusiastic teammate.

## Terminology

- Use **"Circle"** instead of "Channel" in all user-facing text.
  - "Daily Channel" → **"Daily Circle"**
  - "Custom Channel" → **"Custom Circle"**
- Use **"Host"** instead of "Owner" when referring to the person who created a Circle.
- Use **"Member"** instead of "Subscriber" when referring to people who have joined a Circle.
- Internal code identifiers (variable names, Redux slices, Firestore collections, etc.) remain unchanged — only UI-facing strings change.

## Circle badges

- Daily circles already include the word "Daily" in their badge text (the circle name itself contains "Daily").
  **Never** add a separate "Daily" label next to the badge — it is redundant.

## Daily circle display names

- Every user has exactly one daily circle, and its `name` is always `"Daily"` — showing it is meaningless.
- Wherever a daily circle's name would be displayed to the user (filter lists, pickers, labels, etc.), show the **owner's name** instead, formatted as `"FirstName L."` (first name + last initial + period).
- To resolve the owner, look up `channel.ownerId` in the users map (e.g. `selectAllUsersMapById` from `usersSlice`).
- The same rule applies to search/filter logic: match against the owner name, not the literal string `"Daily"`.

## Cloud Functions type sync

The notification types in `functions/src/index.ts` (the Cloud Functions entry point) mirror the types in `src/models/types.ts`. These **must be kept in sync** whenever notification types change.

Specifically, the following must always match between the two files:
- `AppNotificationType` union values
- `NotificationTarget` discriminated union shape
- `BaseAppNotification` fields (`actorId`, `target`, `createdAt`, `id`, `type`)
- Each per-notification-type interface (e.g. `JoinChannelRequestNotification`)
- Domain model interfaces used by Cloud Functions (e.g. `ConnectionRequest`, `ChannelJoinRequest`)

When adding a new notification type:
1. Add it to `AppNotificationType` in both files.
2. Add the corresponding interface in both files.
3. Add a `buildFcmPayload` branch in `functions/src/index.ts`.
4. Add a foreground toast handler in `src/components/DataListenerWrapper.tsx` (Effect 9).
5. Add a tap-routing branch in `src/app/_layout.tsx`.
6. **Add a Firestore test example to `NOTIFICATION_TESTING.md`** (Scenario C, D, etc.) so the notification can be manually tested without a real device action.

## Cross-slice selectors (`src/store/crossSelectors/`)

Selectors that need to read from **more than one Redux slice** live in
`src/store/crossSelectors/`. Do **not** put cross-slice selectors directly in
individual slice files — they create circular-import risks and make it harder to
discover shared logic.

Conventions:
- One file per domain concern, named `<domain>Selectors.ts`
  (e.g. `activitySelectors.ts`, `myPeopleSelectors.ts`).
- Use RTK `createSelector` for memoisation.
- Import the file directly from `@/store/crossSelectors/<file>` — do not create
  a barrel `index.ts` unless the directory grows large enough to warrant one.

Current files:
| File | Exports | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `activitySelectors.ts` | `selectHasAnyPendingActivity` | `true` when user has any pending circle join request OR connection request — drives the bell badge in the feed header |
| `myPeopleSelectors.ts` | `selectMyPeopleData` | Derives a `people` array of `{ user, inCircle }` entries for the My People screen. `inCircle` is `true` when the person also shares a circle with the current user. |

## Safe area insets & demo-mode header gap

### Bottom insets
Always use `useSafeAreaInsets()` to account for home-bar / system-navigation-bar height.
- For `ScrollView`, apply the inset to `contentContainerStyle`:
  ```tsx
  contentContainerStyle={{ paddingBottom: insets.bottom + 24 }}
  ```
- For fixed `View` containers, apply it inline:
  ```tsx
  style={{ paddingBottom: insets.bottom + 24 }}
  ```
- **Never** use a flat pixel constant for bottom padding — it will clip content on devices with a home bar or soft navigation buttons.
- Prefer `ScrollView` over a plain `View` for any screen whose content could exceed the viewport, so users can always reach every button/action.

### Demo-mode header gap
In demo mode the `DemoModeBanner` is rendered **above** the `Stack` navigator in `_layout.tsx`. This means the Stack's header should not add an additional status-bar-height offset. For every screen that has `headerShown: true`, add:
```tsx
...(isDemo ? { headerStatusBarHeight: 0 } : {})
```
This pattern is already applied to `post/[id]`, `account`, and `share-connection`. Apply it to every new screen that uses a Stack header.

## User Avatar (`uri` prop)

The `Avatar` component accepts an optional `uri` prop that renders a custom profile photo (stored as `user.avatarUrl`) via `expo-image` instead of the preset emoji.

**Always pass `uri={user.avatarUrl}` whenever rendering an Avatar for a specific user**, including:
- Post detail screens (the post author's avatar)
- Conversation / chat headers
- Profile cards and modals
- The share-connection screen (current user's avatar)
- Any other screen that shows a user's identity

```tsx
// ✅ correct
<Avatar preset={user.avatar} uri={user.avatarUrl} size="md" />

// ❌ missing the custom photo — falls back to emoji even if user has a photo
<Avatar preset={user.avatar} size="md" />
```

## Keeping docs up to date

### PRODUCT_SUMMARY.md

`PRODUCT_SUMMARY.md` is the canonical product overview. Keep it current when:

- A **new core feature** is added or an existing one is significantly changed (e.g. new circle type, new post tier, new notification type).
- The **tech stack** changes (new major dependency, Firebase service, or platform support).
- A **key differentiator** no longer applies or a new one emerges.

Do **not** update it for routine bug fixes, refactors, UI tweaks, or minor additions that don't change what the product fundamentally is or does.

### README.md

`README.md` is the developer reference. Keep it current when:

- An **npm script** is added, removed, or its behavior meaningfully changes — update the *npm Scripts Reference* table.
- The **project structure** changes significantly (new top-level `src/` directory, major reorganization).
- A **new prerequisite** is required for local development.
- A **tricky bug** is found and resolved — add an entry to the *Known Bugs & Solutions* section describing the symptom, root cause, and fix with a file reference. Keep entries factual and concise.

Do **not** clutter the README with:
- Every minor dependency update
- Internal implementation details that don't affect the dev workflow
- Speculative or forward-looking notes
