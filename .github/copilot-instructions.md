# Copilot Instructions

## App tone

Angelia is a warm, playful, and encouraging app. All user-facing copy — placeholders, labels, empty states, toasts, and prompts — should reflect that energy. Avoid formal, corporate, or overly serious language. Write like a friendly, enthusiastic teammate.

## Terminology

- Use **"Circle"** instead of "Channel" in all user-facing text.
  - "Daily Channel" → **"Daily Circle"**
  - "Custom Channel" → **"Custom Circle"**
- Use **"Host"** instead of "Owner" when referring to the person who created a Circle.
- Use **"Member"** instead of "Subscriber" when referring to people who have joined a Circle.
- Internal code identifiers (variable names, Redux slices, Firestore collections, etc.) remain unchanged — only UI-facing strings change.

## Circle badges

- Daily circles already include the word "Daily" in their badge text (the circle name itself contains "Daily").
  **Never** add a separate "Daily" label next to the badge — it is redundant.

## Daily circle display names

- Every user has exactly one daily circle, and its `name` is always `"Daily"` — showing it is meaningless.
- Wherever a daily circle's name would be displayed to the user (filter lists, pickers, labels, etc.), show the **owner's name** instead, formatted as `"FirstName L."` (first name + last initial + period).
- To resolve the owner, look up `channel.ownerId` in the users map (e.g. `selectAllUsersMapById` from `usersSlice`).
- The same rule applies to search/filter logic: match against the owner name, not the literal string `"Daily"`.

## Keeping docs up to date

### PRODUCT_SUMMARY.md

`PRODUCT_SUMMARY.md` is the canonical product overview. Keep it current when:

- A **new core feature** is added or an existing one is significantly changed (e.g. new circle type, new post tier, new notification type).
- The **tech stack** changes (new major dependency, Firebase service, or platform support).
- A **key differentiator** no longer applies or a new one emerges.

Do **not** update it for routine bug fixes, refactors, UI tweaks, or minor additions that don't change what the product fundamentally is or does.

### README.md

`README.md` is the developer reference. Keep it current when:

- An **npm script** is added, removed, or its behavior meaningfully changes — update the *npm Scripts Reference* table.
- The **project structure** changes significantly (new top-level `src/` directory, major reorganization).
- A **new prerequisite** is required for local development.
- A **tricky bug** is found and resolved — add an entry to the *Known Bugs & Solutions* section describing the symptom, root cause, and fix with a file reference. Keep entries factual and concise.

Do **not** clutter the README with:
- Every minor dependency update
- Internal implementation details that don't affect the dev workflow
- Speculative or forward-looking notes
